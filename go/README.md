## jelly/go

This folder is currently for porting Jelly into Go. The main new developments are happening in `jelly/ocaml`, but I'm writing Jelly in Go as well because:

- I want to compare my experiences with writing Jelly in a functional vs. imperative language.
- I want to stay fresh on my Go skills while I'm not working in it. (because it's one of my favorite languages ever!)
- I heard that Go's compiler is self-hosted.
